## life is too short for only one hobby

A renaissance dad's documentation of the discovery of life after parenthood.

Over the years, I have calmed down significantly and as the dust settles, I am beginning to take stock of what I have and what I dont want in my life anymore.

And since I tend to loose focus of what it is that I am doing and what I am working on, some documentation is needed. This will happen here, in this repository.

Oh gosh does it feel important and pompous writing this. But I guess it comes with the territory of writing personal stuff in public. I will get used to it.

In the end, it is not how I am feeling about this, it's just how the voice in my head is reading it to me. Impersonating you, dear reader. But I have no idea 
what is going on in your head. If this is being read by anyone in the first place.


## so what's the matter?

As I attempted to say earlier, I have many interests. Many things I would like to learn or at least understand. And since this might change from week to week, I want 
to keep track of my progress. Of what I understand about a topic and what I want to continue with on the next round. These topics include music and its creation, photography and generative art,
web tech and data visualization, cooking and table top games, triathlon training and gardening, traveling and writing prose, drawing and meditation.

All this and more is going on in my life and on top, I am working full time, have a family and a social life. Yeah, the agenda is full.

So that is going on and well, here is yet another attempt to preserve all this and distill it for future reference into some digestible format. Let's see if I can make it work this time.
